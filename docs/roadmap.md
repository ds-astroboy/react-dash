# Roadmap

The react dash project is currently under very active development. There are a number of supported projects out in the wild (see @@Examples and Uses). That said, the React Dash was developed quickly under real-world pressure to deliver projects under deadline.

## Redux

## Versioning
React Dash loosely follow semantic versioning (@@LINK)

## Backwards Compatibility
Until version 1.0.0 is released, we do not guarantee backwards compatibility. We do, however, intend to maintain an upgrade path for projects implemented with earlier versions of the library.
