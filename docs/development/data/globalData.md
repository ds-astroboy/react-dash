# Global Data

Data which is set to the top-level Dashboard component is passed to all components as a `globalData` prop. It is also available inside of data handlers as the `dashboardData` argument. Data is assigned to the dashboard as a whole in the same way as it is assigned components, using data, backends, or customDatahandlers.
